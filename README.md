## Nooks Watch Party Project

In this takehome project, we want to understand your:
- ability to build something non-trivial from scratch
- comfort picking up unfamiliar technologies
- architectural decisions, abstractions, and rigor

We want to respect your time, so please try not to spend more than 5 hours on this. We know that this is a challenging task & you are under time pressure and will keep that in mind when evaluating your solution.

### Instructions

To run the app simply "npm i" and then "npm start"

### Problem
Your task is to build a collaborative ‚ÄúWatch Party‚Äù app that lets a distributed group of users watch youtube videos together. The frontend should be written in Typescript (we have a skeleton for you set up) and the backend should be written in Node.JS. The app should support two main pages:

- `/create` **Create a new session**
    - by giving it a name and a youtube video link. After creating a session `ABC`, you should be automatically redirected to the page `/watch` page for that session
- `/watch/:sessionId` **Join an existing session**
    
    *‚ö†Ô∏è The player must be **synced for all users at all times** no matter when they join the party*
    
    - **Playing/pausing/seek** the video. When someone plays/pauses the video or jumps to a certain time in the video, this should update for everyone in the session
    - **Late to the party**... Everything should stay synced if a user joins the session late (e.g. if the video was already playing, the new user should see it playing at the correct time)
        
### Assumptions

- This app obviously **doesn‚Äôt need to be production-ready**, but you should at least be aware of any issues you may encounter in more real-world scenarios.
- We gave you all of the frontend UX you‚Äôll need in the [starter repo](https://github.com/NooksApp/nooks-fullstack-takehome), including skeleton pages for the `create` and `watch` routes, so you can focus on implementing the core backend functionality & frontend video playing logic for the app.
- You should probably use **websockets** to keep state synchronized between multiple users.

You will need to embed a Youtube video directly in the website. In our skeleton code we use [react-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player), but feel free to use another library or use the [Youtube IFrame API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference) directly.

In order to sync the video, you‚Äôll need to know when any user plays, pauses, or seeks in their own player and transmit that information to everyone else. In order to get play, pause, and seek events you can use:
1. [YouTube iFrame API - Events](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Events)
2. Build your own custom controls for play, pause & seek. If you choose  this option, make sure the controls UX works very similarly to youtube‚Äôs standard controls (e.g. play/pause button and a slider for seek)

### Required Functionality

- [ ] **Creating a session**. Any user should be able to create a session to watch a given Youtube video.
- [ ] **Joining a session**. Any user should be able to join a session created by another user using the shareable session link.
- [ ] **Playing/pausing** the video. When a participant pauses the video, it should pause for everyone. When a participant plays the video, it should start playing for everyone.
- [ ] **‚ÄúSeek‚Äù**. When someone jumps to a certain time in the video it should jump to that time for everyone.
- [ ] **Late to the party**... Everything should stay synced even if a user joins the watch party late (e.g. the video is already playing)
- [ ] **Player controls.** All the player controls (e.g. play, pause, and seek) should be intuitive and behave as expected. For play, pause & seek operations you can use the built-in YouTube controls or disable the YouTube controls and build your own UI (including a slider for the seek operation)

### Architecture Questions

After building the watch party app, we would like you to answer the following questions about design decisions and tradeoffs you made while building it. Please fill them out in the README along with your submission.

1. **How did you approach the problem? What did you choose to learn or work on first? Did any unexpected difficulties come up - if so, how did you resolve them?**

My first thoughts were to avoid locking and some sort of server coordination. Thought it would be simplest to have the server act as a proxy for a peer-to-peer network. From my research at Berkeley, I learned about CRDTs and how they can avoid expensive coordination wherein by using specific data structures we can merge state udpates with minimal overhead on the server. I chose to use the last writer wins semantic since it makes sense that whoever sent in their update most recently should be reflected on the server. Using CRDT's is nice since it also allows users to make changes locally first without permission from the server. I also wanted to succintly represent the server's state, which I did with hybrid logical clock. We can use physical time to denote the "winner" for concurrent updates, and tie-break with logical clock for client updates sent simutaneously and then fall back on client id as a tie-breaker.

I was thinking about also using tRPC, but only have used gRPC, so decided to go with typescript to keep it simple for the backend. I know there are other solutions to resolving concurrent updates, but I wanted to keep it simple and try out the techniques I learned from reading research papers. I know they're used in the real world too (Amazon uses CRDTs for DynamoDB).

Some problems were avoiding excessive server updates. With CRDT semantics it became easy to coalesce updates on the server, but I also added a debouncing mechanism on the client side to avoid sending updates too frequently.

Honestly, not too many problems on the server. I used AI to program the frontend and iterate, so it did most of the hardwork. I contemplated using Cypress to test the frontend, but decided it was overkill for this project.

2. **How did you implement seeking to different times in the video? Are there any other approaches you considered and what are the tradeoffs between them?**

Client sends a full CRDT state update on seek, the server coalesces updates and sends a broadcast. Peers basically do
```
currentPos = pos + ( now() ‚àí ts ) / 1000
```
which is accounting for network transmission time, when we do `now() - ts` and add that to position.

I honestly didn't consider other approaches, since I couldn't think of a better solution than this, and it seemed to be simple and efficient enough for my use cases. I'd probably have to add some logging/tracing to see if there are any issues with this approach.

3. **How do new users know what time to join the watch party? Are there any other approaches you considered and what were the tradeoffs between them?**

New users receive most up to date state from the server. The state is quite succint, so everything fell into place after coming up with the structure of the state. 

```
/** Hybrid Logical Clock */
export interface HLC {
  p: number;    // physical time in ms
  l: number;    // logical counter
  c: string;    // client / session id
}
/** Video playhead state */
export interface PlayheadState {
  ts: HLC;
  pos: number;      // seconds
  playing: boolean;
  url?: string;     // YouTube URL
}
```

I could use existing mechanisms when using this state, so didn't consider anything else!

4. **How do you guarantee that the time that a new user joins is accurate (i.e perfectly in sync with the other users in the session) and are there any edge cases where it isn‚Äôt? Think about cases that might occur with real production traffic.**



5. **Are there any other situations - i.e race conditions, edge cases - where one user can be out of sync with another? (Out of sync meaning that user A has the video playing or paused at some time, while user B has the video playing or paused at some other time.)**

6. **How would you productionize this application to a scale where it needs to be used reliably with 1M+ DAUs and 10k people connected to a single session? Think infrastructure changes, code changes & UX changes.**
